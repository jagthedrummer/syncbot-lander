    <h1 id="how-syncbot-works">How Syncbot Works</h1>

<h2 id="syncbot-is-a-desktop-application-for-macos">Syncbot is a Desktop application for MacOS</h2>

<p>Syncbot is primarily a desktop application.
For now you'll need to use the <a href="https://app.syncbot.media/">web site</a> to create new teams and to invite people to your teams.
But for working with project and collaborating with other people you'll primarily use the app.</p>

<p>Syncbot supports Logic Pro X and Ableton Live sessions.</p>

<h2 id="syncbot-is-alpha-software">Syncbot is alpha software!</h2>

<p>Please be aware that there's a small risk that Syncbot could somehow corrupt a project session.</p>

<p>The chances are slim that it will happen, and even slimmer that it would do so in a way that would
be completely unrecoverable.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, during the early testing phase <strong>I'd recommend keeping a copy of sessions that you
really care about somewhere outside of your <code>~/Syncbot</code> folder.</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-desktop-app-operates-on-your-syncbot-folder">The desktop app operates on your <code>~/Syncbot</code> folder</h2>

<p>After installing the app it will prompt you to open your <code>Syncbot</code> folder.
Then you can drop a Logic or Ableton session into that folder (or create a new session and save it there)
and then Syncbot will automatically upload that project into your "Personal" team.
Which leads us toâ€¦</p>

<h2 id="syncbot-is-team-based">Syncbot is team-based</h2>

<p>Syncbot is all about collaborating with others, and the way to do that is with a team.</p>

<p>We also know that you might want to work on some stuff by yourself,
and that's why you get a "Personal" team that's just for you.</p>

<p>Whenever you add a project to your <code>Syncbot</code> folder it will first go into your "Personal" team.
Each time you save the session Syncbot will automatically upload your changes.</p>

<p>When you're ready to share the project with a collaborator you can use the web site to create a neww team.
Once you've done that you can invite anyone to participate on that team.
Any projects you share with the team will be available to anyone who's on the team.</p>

<p>To share a project with a team you can click on the project in the desktop app, then go to the "Teams" tab.
There you'll see a list of all your teams and you'll have the option to share the project with any of them.</p>
